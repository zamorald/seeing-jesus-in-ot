# Introduction
## A New Ancient Reading
It has been said, “If it’s true, it’s not new; if it’s new, it’s not true.”  The slogan is an oversimplification.  The word of God is indeed the truth and the only truth--and it’s not new, so nothing true can be new.  But something true can be new to us.  The saying only holds if we already know everything there is to know.  

That something ancient might have been overlooked by us moderns should come as no surprise.  

> Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.  (Exodus 1:8)  

> Now these are the nations that the Lord left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan. It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before.  (Judges 3:1-2)  

> Jesus declared, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children.” (Matthew 11:25)  

We ought to look for the methods employed by the inspired authors when they interpreted Moses and the prophets.  How did the Gospel writers employ prophesy?  How did the apostles support their teaching with Scripture?  

Didn’t the Lord Himself also call for a new reading of the old writings on the road to Emmaus?  

> Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.  (Luke 24:27)  

The apostles used the confidence gained from this reading to preach the gospel to the entire world.

## Benefits
### The Scriptures Come Alive!
Suddenly there is no filler in the Old Testament.  There are no history books or geography lessons, no fact books to speak of.  The entire text and its content are a medium for symbolizing the Christ.  Every page argues for Him.  

One comes to realize Job’s protest, “Why did I not die at birth, / come out from the womb and expire?” points to the need for the Christ to have a body, live a life—even a painful one—and first be tested and found obedient before succumbing to death (Job 3:11; c.p., Hebrews 5:8, 10:5-7).  As Jesus said, “Wasn’t it necessary that the Christ should suffer?” (Luke 24:26)
